My coding work included developing code that shows order nutrition subtotals on the checkout page as seen below

Additionally, I also developed code that would display the nutrition facts right next to the item on its product page. However, this was simpler than creating the 
subtotals as retreiving the facts for items was much simpler from their product page (as there would be only one product that a call could reference), whereas 
on the checkout page the location where the elements would be retrieved from was much harder to identify and use as there would be multiple items. This is what 
the individual product looks like:

All of these values dynamically appear depending on the product(s). (Essentially, I didn't hard code the information).
